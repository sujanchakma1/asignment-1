          Dr. Mohammad Yunus is a Bangladeshi social entrepreneur, banker, and economist, best known for his pioneering work in microfinance and social business. He founded Grameen Bank in 1983, which provided small loans to impoverished people, particularly women, without requiring collateral. This innovative model helped lift millions of people out of poverty by empowering them with access to credit, which they could use to start or expand small businesses.
          Dr. Yunus' work with microcredit earned him international recognition, and in 2006, he and Grameen Bank were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their efforts to create economic and social development from below. His vision for social business, a model of business designed to address societal problems while being financially sustainable, has had a lasting influence on global poverty alleviation and social entrepreneurship.
